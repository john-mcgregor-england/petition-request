# Intro

I'd like to ask my MP to present a petition, following this format:   
https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/sign-a-petition/paper-petitions/

The petition is to allow small communities the power to request deployment of armed forces in their neighbourhood:

```
[...]
The armed forces do not maintain specific forces to assist civil authorities, as assistance is provided depending on the requirement.
[...]
Do soldiers carry their weapons?
Very rarely. Explicit authorisation is required for personnel to be armed.
[...]
Can soldiers arrest people?
Responsibility for law enforcement lies with the police and the Home Office. The MOD guidance is clear that all MACA operations must be conducted within the law. Unlike the police, service personnel only have the same powers of arrest as ordinary citizens.
[...]
Who pays?
With a few exceptions, MACA activity is not funded from the Defence budget. As such, the Ministry of Defence can recover the costs involved, depending on the assistance required. There is no cost involved if an immediate military intervention is required to prevent the loss of life. Full costs are recovered for non-emergency, planned routine support.
```

A group of neighbours could work with the council and privately owned business in the area to request routine support of the armed forces to patrol their streets.    
The MOD then provides an estimate of the costs for the operation, an the residents decide if they want to hire their services. 

The idea of this petition is to help the british taxpayer to enjoy up close the benefits of contributing to the defense budget.    

For example, deprived areas with high crime rates and dark streets could start with as little as two non-armed soldiers standing near the the exit of a train station during peak hour.
High streets, or areas with a large group of shops could put more money together and request for a small platoon to patrol the streets from 1800 till 0700 to avoid damage caused by vandalism. 

The soldiers could perform citizen arrests and restrain the suspect if they are subjected to, or are witnesses of, indecent assault (when interpreted as touching someone without their conscent)

```
Indictable offences are more serious; these are tried at a Crown Court in front of a Judge and Jury and include aggravated burglary, murder, and indecent assault.
[...]
In order for your Citizenâ€™s Arrest to be lawful, the offence that you believe has been, or is being committed has to fall within the Indictable category.
