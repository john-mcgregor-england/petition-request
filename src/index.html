<!--

There are certain rules that a public petition must comply with in order for an MP to present it to the House:

It must address the House of Commons directly and make a clear request for the House to do something which it has the power to do, or to ask the Commons to urge the Government to take action.
It should use respectful language and must not be offensive.
It must have no crossings out, deletions or extra text added to it after it has been signed.
It must be clear that the final petition is the same one that the petitioners signed.
It should be in English, or if not in English accompanied by a translation certified by an MP.
It should have the names, addresses and original, handwritten signatures (photocopies and electronic signatures are not permitted) of the petitioners.
The signatures should match the description of the petitioners (i.e. if the description is ‘The petition of residents of the UK’, the signatures should be of residents of the UK).
It should contain the full petition text with signatures on the first sheet and just the ‘prayer’ of the petition (the paragraph beginning ‘the petitioners therefore request’) on any subsequent sheets of signatures.
